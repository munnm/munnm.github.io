# About

I am a Senior Research Software Engineer at [Google Research](https://research.google/) NY Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Princeton ORFE](https://orfe.princeton.edu/), where I am work on **deep learning theory**. 
<!--  -->

Previously, at Google, I was an ML Solutions Engineer in [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?e=0) working in the [Advanced Solutions Lab](https://cloud.google.com/asl).
<!--  -->
Prior to my Google and my switch to industry, I was a pure mathematics professor....

You can find my CV [here](files/munn_resume.pdf).

# Research

I am broadly interested in studying the theoretical foundations of machine learning and how to leverage those insights to construct more efficient training and optimization algorithms. Recenlty, I have been thinking a lot about the implicit biases inherent in transfer learning and fine-tuning and the training dynamics of large deep learning models. 

You can find a list of my research work
[here](https://munnmi.github.io/research/). 

# Books

I'm also a published O'Reilly author and have written two books on machine learning. These are not research books but instead written for an audience of ML/AI Engineers and practitioners developing and productionizing ML models.
