# About

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Princeton ORFE](https://orfe.princeton.edu/), where I am working with [Boris Hanin](https://boris-hanin.github.io/) on **deep learning theory**. 
<!--  -->
In July 2025, I will be joining the University of Waterloo as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/). 

Previously, I received my PhD from the [Department of Statistical Sciences](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto
and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/),
where my advisors were [Daniel Roy](http://danroy.org/)
and [Murat Erdogdu](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~erdogdu/).
<!--  -->
Prior to my PhD, I received my MSc in Statistics from the same department, and my BASc in [Engineering Science](http://engsci.utoronto.ca/) from University of Toronto. 

<!-- Previously I was a Masters student in the same department, during which I worked with [Prof. Jeffrey Rosenthal](http://probability.ca/jeff/). For my undergraduate degree I studied [Engineering Science](http://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at University of Toronto, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My undergraduate thesis was supervised by [Prof. Christina Christara](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ccc/).  -->

# Research

I am broadly interested in studying theoretical properties
of random algorithms in statistical learning.
Most recently, I have been thinking a lot about **scaling limits** of large neural networks and their training dynamics.

# Blog

I attempt to maintain a blog of interesting mathematics I encounter, 
but does not necessarily fit into my research program.
