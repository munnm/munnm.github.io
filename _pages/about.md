# About

I am a Senior Research Software Engineer at [Google Research](https://research.google/) NY. My work is focused on **foundational research in machine learning** and how these theoretical insights can be applied to improve **ML efficiency**, especially in the context of **fine-tuning**.

Previously, at Google, I was an ML Solutions Engineer in [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?e=0) working closely with Cloud customers to build and productionize machine learning models at scale. In my role within the [Advanced Solutions Lab](https://cloud.google.com/asl), I also led a 4-week intensive training course teaching the tools, techniques, and best practices needed to train and deploy their own ML solutions. 

Prior to Google and my switch to industry, I had a career in academia as a research mathematics professor in the field of geometric analysis.

You can find my CV [here](files/munn_resume.pdf).

# Research

I am broadly interested in studying the theoretical foundations of machine learning and how to leverage those insights to construct more efficient training and optimization algorithms. Recently, I have been thinking a lot about *transfer learning* and *fine-tuning*, particularly how implicit biases can be leveraged to improve the training dynamics of large deep learning models. 

You can find a list of my research work [here](https://munnm.github.io/research/). 

# Books

I'm also a published O'Reilly author and have written two books on machine learning. These are not research books but instead intended for a general audience of ML/AI Engineers and practitioners. You can see short summaries [here](https://munnm.github.io/books/).

# Community

In addition to my primary role at Google, I also volunteer as an AI Coach with [Google.org](https://www.google.org), the non-profit arm of Google. There, I advise and mentor early and late-stage startups using AI for social good. I'm currently participating in Google.org's Generative AI Accelerator program. You can find description of this volunteer work [here](https://munnm.github.io/community/).
