I am a PhD student in the [Department of Statistical Sciences](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. 
My academic advisor is [Prof. Daniel Roy](http://danroy.org/).
This is my blog for interesting side reading and projects.

Previously I was a Masters student in the same department, during which I worked with [Prof. Jeffrey Rosenthal](http://probability.ca/jeff/). For my undergraduate degree I studied [Engineering Science](http://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at University of Toronto, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My undergraduate thesis was supervised by [Prof. Christina Christara](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ccc/). You can find my CV [here](CV_Mufan_Li.pdf).

### Research

I am currently pursuing research in statistical learning theory, 
in particular applying techniques of probability theory, 
stochastic analysis, and PDEs.
