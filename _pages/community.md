Separate from my research role at Google, I also volunteer as an AI Coach with [Google.org](https://www.google.org), the philanthropic arm of Google focused on solving some of humanity’s biggest challenges in education, inclusion, economic opportunity, crisis response and racial justice.

## GenAI Accelerator

The [Generative AI Accelerator](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-org/google-generative-ai-accelerator-nonprofits/) is a 6-month global pro bono program that aims to accelerate the work of 21 nonprofit organizations working with generative AI by providing mentorship, technical training and pro bono support. Currently I'm working with two companies: [Materiom](https://materiom.org/) and [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/). 

Materiom is a UK-based startup whose mission is to accelerate the research, development, and uptake of materials that have a net-positive impact on the planet. They offer biomaterial developers a platform where they can access, collaborate and contribute new biomaterial formulations. 

Full Fact is the UK's independent fact checking organisation. Their mission is to promote accuracy and accountability in public debate by systematically fact checking claims made by politicians, public figures, and the media. 

## Google.org Fellowship with The Trevor Project

During 2020-2021, I acted as Technical Lead for a Google.org Fellowship working with The Trevor Project. The Trevor Project's mission is to end suicide among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) young people. Through their crisis services, they provide free 24/7 confidential crisis intervention services via phone, text and online chat. 

Working with a team of engineers at Google and The Trevor Project, we built an LLM based Conversation Simulator that they currenlty use to help train volunteers on various role-play scenarios. **External press:** [MIT Tech Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/26/1020010/trevor-project-ai-suicide-hotline-training), [Time Magazine's Best Inventions of 2021](https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2021/6113112/crisis-contact-simulator/), [Google I/O ‘21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKkjCQlS1g4&t=1545s), [NBC Today show segment](https://www.today.com/video/how-the-trevor-project-uses-technology-to-help-save-lives-92848709676), and [Google.org blog post](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-org/trevor-project/).
